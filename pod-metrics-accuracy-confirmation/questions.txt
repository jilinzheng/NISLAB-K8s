Here are some questions I have:
1. Are the nginx deployment and service files correctly configured for prometheus scraping? I know they have to include the 'prometheus.io/scrape' and 'prometheus.io/port' annotations. When I added them into the deployment file's metadata.annotations, nothing happened: I was seeing one pod with a lot of cpu activity, but almost none for the others; similarly, one pod had much more memory than the others. After adding the annotations to spec.template.metadata.annotations, I saw the pods at a lower cpu usage, but all the pods were around the same usage. Memory for the different pods was also around the same, with exception of one pod that was always greater than the others. I have included a screenshot of the Grafana dashboard that reflects this change.
